# Master's project

The repository presents the Matlab project, which was created to recognize expressions in sign language using RGB-D data and deep learning.   
This project was used by me in my master's thesis for research and experiments.

## About the thesis

Recognition of expressions in sign language with the use of RGB-D data and deep learning.

The purpose of this thesis was to develop a solution that would allow to recognize expressions in sign language.   
This thesis contains a description of the ideas and strategies of deep learning with the use of convolutional neural network (CNN),
recursive neural network (RNN) and a series of experiments.   
The proposed solution consists of the learned GoogLeNet convolutional network and the recursive network in the form of Bi-LSTM cells, 
which were validated using leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) cross-validation.
